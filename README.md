# automation-api-smoke

**API smoke test.** Checks an API's key routes from a JSON file: status, response fields, slowness. Tokens come from the environment.

Node.js 18+, **no dependencies**, **MIT** licence. No data is sent anywhere: only the addresses you give are contacted. The scripts print their messages in French.

## Usage

```bash
API_TOKEN=… node src/api-smoke.mjs smoke.json
```

Run it with `--help` for the built-in options (the scripts print in French).

## Step-by-step guide

## Limits
